# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Overview/Description
This site pulls weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays it in a dashboard. The user can search for a city and the current weather and a five day forecast will be displayed. 

## Libraries Used
For this project, I used the following libraries: Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I also used the OpenWeather API to pull weather data and the cities coordinates.

## Future Development
In the future, I would like to make the site more user friendly by adding more options to the site like dark mode and the ability to change the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. I would also like to add more information to the site like the UV index and the wind direction. Finally I would like to add more styling to the site to make it more visually appealing.

## Help
I was not able to make the site load the weather data for the last city searched. I tried to use localStorage to store the data but I was not able to get it to work.
